        <b>4. Gandhamardan Hills </b>, situated between Balangir and Bargarh
        districts in Odisha, India, is a region of immense ecological, cultural,
        and historical significance. Famous for its abundance of medicinal
        plants, the hills house a Bauxite reserve that was once under
        consideration for exploration through a private venture sanctioned by
        the state government. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Hanuman carried
        the Gandhamardan hill on his shoulders from the Himalayas to save the
        life of Lakshman during the Treta Yug. The hill is believed to be a
        portion that dropped during Hanuman's journey. The Nrusinghanath Temple
        is located on the northern slope, and the Harishankar Temple is on the
        southern slope of Gandhamardan, adding to the cultural richness of the
        area. During the Mahabharat period, Sage Drona resided on Gandhamardan,
        imparting the art of weaponry to selected pupils. Scholars speculate
        that this mountain might have been the site of Nagarjuna's monastery, a
        reference made by Hiuen-Tsiang in his chronicles.
